                <p>I'm an orange tabby cat with a curious and dastardly attitude. I'm as likely to cuddle with you as I am to bite your toes. I've been a professional cat for 3 years now, with an expertise in getting into trouble and not caring.</p>

                <p>Trouble-maker expert, coniseur of cheese, nap king, uncaring face master. I love to instigate fights with the dog.</p>
